# How can we help predict when and where traffic will occur in the City of Austin? 
## Context
###### Cintas is a company that delivers clean uniforms to customers around the city.  They plan their delivery routes based on zipcodes. Is this the best way to plan a route given traffic patterns?

Delivery truck routes are created based on zip codes which can be an inefficient method of plotting routes.

Constructing delivery routes in this manner does not take into account the domain knowledge of city roads necessary to implement maximally efficient routes.

Speaking with a local delivery business that has 36 routes in Austin, and that they plan their routes by zip code. 

When we create route maps based purely on zip codes, we do not take traffic into account. While a gps may help one navigate this real time, it does not inform route planning.  

If we could use common traffic patterns to better plan routes, this would improve efficiency and save time and money.
